# WPI Karaoke Mugen Database

This a database repository intended for use with [Karaoke Mugen](http://karaokes.moe).

## Hangul / 한글

We have customized versions of some songs with Hangul subtitles.
We're planning to submit these once alternate lyric versions is supported in KM.

## Furigana / 振り仮名

We have customized versions of some songs with Furigana subtitles.
There are currently some technical issues with the way we do Furigana subtitles which causes issues when working with unknown screen resolutions.
We're planning to submit these once we resolve that issue and alternate lyric versions is supported in KM.

## WIP

We're working on some songs which we intend to submit to the main database once finished.
If and when these entries are accepted into the main database, we'll remove it from this one to avoid potential conflicts.

## Can I use this freely?

More or less, yes. See the [license](LICENSE.md) for more details.
